# I would implement if I had more time:

- I would implement to show day by day for the forecasts as we have date and times.
- Search Button; to give option to change city to user.
- Detailed View; as we get detailed data from API such as hourly forecast. 
- Implement a css processor and move all styles unders moduler css classes.
- Implement better error handling for the API requests.
- Implement another base module for API calls.
- Add a search bar to allow users to search for the weather in different locations.
- Implement a loading spinner while the weather data is being fetched.
- Improve the styling and layout of the app.
- More test cases.
- Have separate commits for the development.
- I normally would not push API key and also .env files as well, I've pushed those files to review easy for now as it's not sensitive key at the moment.
